# PACCAT

## Introduction
PACCAT is a small game based on the classic Pacman, infused with roguelike elements. Featuring a kitten as the protagonist, PACCAT offers a fresh take on the familiar gameplay with unique adaptations.

## Features
- **Kitten Protagonist**: Paccman has been transformed into a charming kitten, with ghosts now being a group of dogs with random appearances.
- **Special Beans**:
  - **Catnip (Speed_up Bean)**: Increases Paccat's speed by 1.5 times for 10 seconds.
  - **Bone (Freeze Bean)**: Freezes all dogs in place for 5 seconds.
  - **Rain (Power Bean)**: Grants Paccat the power to drive away dogs.
- **Level Design**: Redesigned wall placements for a new challenge.
- **Artwork**: All art effects have been modified to fit the new theme.

## Development
We primarily used `pygame` for development, alongside `sys` and `random` libraries.

### Technical Challenges
- We attempted to modify PACCAT into a local two-player game but encountered numerous bugs. For now, we have focused on refining the single-player experience and plan to continue working on it after the course.

## Division of Work
- **YUAN Yizhi_24061968g**: Participated in the realization of the original Pacman effects and adapted them for PACCAT.
- **TAN Xin_24062995g**: Realized the original Pacman effects and created all the art assets.

## Special Thanks
We would like to extend our gratitude to 雨天 (Rain) for their technical guidance and assistance.
